# What is it? #

Are you sick and tired of 'accidentally' deleting or overwriting that important Saved Game? Are you tired of finding ways to stop this from happening? Well, look no further! This script automatically creates back-up files of Saved Games when they are overwritten or deleted (Fine print: Only creates a back-up if the saved game is deleted in-game). But wait! Use it now and get a free cookie! That's right, use this script could be yours today.

# Features #
1. Define your very own Saved Game extensions.
2. Define where Saved Games are saved. Do you want your games saved in a the 'Saves' folder? Or perhaps the 'Saves/Saves/Save/Saves/Saves' folder? You decide.
3. Unlimited amount of Saved game slots. Sick of RMXPs default Saved Slot limit of 4? Now you can use up to infinity.
4. Automatically creates a back-up of Overwritten Saved Games and places them in the Back-up folder.
5. Automatically creates a back-up when a file is deleted and places it into the back-up folder.
6. Saves backed up Saved Games by the amount of time you played them.
7. Confirmation screen. Asks to confirm overwriting, so no more -accidental- rewrites happen. Even if they did, a back-up would be made. So you are safe :)
8. Delete Saved Game files in-game.
9. Save Games ANYWHERE on the hard drive. Running a game from a CD? Save the Saved Game to the C drive.
